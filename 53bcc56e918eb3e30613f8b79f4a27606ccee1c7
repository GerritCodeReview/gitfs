      "message": "This is only needed by our setup because our proxy doesn\u0027t support the CONNECT verb, it\u0027s not a general property of proxies running on localhost.\n\nAlso you would probably want to check for ::1 as well. Is there a library function to do that? Maybe something that gives you a list of loopback addresses?",

      "message": "This shouldn\u0027t be necessary. Our proxy configuration already rewrites https-\u003ehttp in Location headers (and also removes the secure bit from cookies). The need to do this is one reason it doesn\u0027t support CONNECT.\n\nThe case where you need to rewrite is where your user, not the server, presents a URL that looks like https://foo but you need to rewrite it before connecting to the proxy.",
